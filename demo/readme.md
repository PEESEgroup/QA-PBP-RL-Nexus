`demo/sample_data`: This folder contains a sample policy already trained for demonstration purposes. Users are recommended to use their own files to generate peptides.

`demo/PPO_pbp.py`: This script provides a demo with sample input to train a policy for peptide design using PPO.

`demo/PPO_pbp.py`: PPO_pbp.py consists of a demo script with sample input to train policy for peptide design. 

`demo/ppo_pbp_generation.py`: This script demonstrates how to generate peptides using a PPO policy.

`demo/qa_pbp_generation.py`: This script demonstrates how to generate peptides using Quantum Annealing. For demonstration purposes, a random sampler is used to illustrate the peptide design workflow.
