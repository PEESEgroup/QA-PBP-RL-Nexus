`demo/sample_data`: This folder contains a trained policy already trained for demonstration purposes. Users are recommended to use their own files to generate peptides.
  
  `demo/sample_data/PPO_Policy.pth`: This files contains an example policy learned using demo/PPO_pbp.py
  `demo/sample_data/PairwiseEnergy_sample.xlsx`: This file contains sample pairwise energy for given backbone arrangment to derive new generated peptides.
  `demo/sample_data/PairwiseEnergy.txt`: This file contains sample pairwise energy in txt form.
  `demo/sample_data/SingleEnergy_sample.xlsx`: : This file contains sample single energy for given backbone arrangment to derive new generated peptides.
  `demo/sample_data/SingleEnergy.txt`: This file contains sample single energy in txt form.

`demo/PPO_pbp.py`: This script provides a demo with sample input to train a policy for peptide design using PPO.

`demo/PPO_pbp.py`: PPO_pbp.py consists of a demo script with sample input to train policy for peptide design. 

`demo/ppo_pbp_generation.py`: This script demonstrates how to generate peptides using a PPO policy.

`demo/qa_pbp_generation.py`: This script demonstrates how to generate peptides using Quantum Annealing. For demonstration purposes, a random sampler is used to illustrate the peptide design workflow.
