- `PottsModel_Energies` contains one-body energies (SingleEnergy.txt) and two-body energies (Pairwise.txt) for each system conformations (termed a "bb" for backbone) for polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

- `Data Folder/PPO_All_Sequences_All_Conformations` contains PPO solutions for all system conformations. As described in the manuscript, PPO was only performed for a subset of the system conformations for polyethylene. The system conformation numbering is consistent with the directory `PottsModel_Energies/PE` (e.g., bb1 is the same system in these two directories).

- `Peptide Design with QA+RL PNAS Nexus SI Data File.xlsx` contains all raw data for the manuscript. The overview sheet summarizes the contents.
