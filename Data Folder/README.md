`PottsModel_Energies` contains one-body energies (SingleEnergy.txt) and two-body energies (Pairwise.txt) for each system conformations (termed a "bb" for backbone) for polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

`PPO_All_Sequences_All_Conformations` contains PPO solutions for all system conformations. Results are only for polyethylene, and the system conformation numbering is consistent with the directory PottsModel_Energies/PE (e.g., bb1 is the same system in these two directories)

`Peptide Design with QA+RL PNAS Nexus SI Data File.xlsx` contains all raw data for the manuscript. The overview sheet summarizes the contents.
